    /// 😊 That's it.
    BSZoomGridScrollView(imagesToZoom: imagesToZoom,
                         powerOfZoomBounce: .regular,
                         numberOfColumns: 200,
                         numberOfRows: 10,
                         didLongPressItem: { selectedImage in
                            print("on long press : ", selectedImage)
                            /// Grab an image user end up choosing.
                            self.selectedImage = selectedImage

                         },
                         didFinishDraggingOnItem: { selectedImage in
                            print("on drag finish : ", selectedImage)
    })
    .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
    .sheet(isPresented:self.$showSelectedImageView) {
        /// The example view showing a picked up image.
        ShowingSelectedImageView(selectedImage: self.selectedImage)
    }
}
```

## Features

Getting Started
--------------- 

* SwiftUI

```Swift
import SwiftUI

/// 🥳 # Step1: let's import!
import BSZoomGridScrollView

struct ContentView: View {
    var itemsToZoom: [UIImage] = {
        var images = [UIImage]()
        for i in 0...29 {
            images.append(UIImage(named: "yourImage\(i)") ?? UIImage())
        }
        return images
    }()
    
    var body: some View {
        /// 😊 # Step2. That's it. completed!
        BSZoomGridScrollView(itemsToZoom: itemsToZoom,
                             powerOfZoomBounce: .regular,
                             isBeingDraggingOnItem:{ selectedImage in
                                ///
                             },
                             didLongPressItem: { selectedImage in
                                /// Grab an image user ends up choosing.
                             },
                             didFinishDraggingOnItem: { selectedImage in
                                /// Grab an image user ends up choosing.
        })
        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
    }
}
```

* UIKit
```Swift
///
/// To use BSZoomGridScrollView,
/// Please, Follow steps written in the comments with icon like 😀.
///

    // 😋 #Step2: declare BSZoomGridScrollView
    ///
    private lazy var zoomGridScrollViewController: BSZoomGridScrollViewController = { [unowned self] in
        ///
        /// It can be used on both SwiftUI and UIKit.

```

## Installation

There are four ways to use BSZoomGridScrollView in your project:
- using CocoaPods
- using Swift Package Manager
- manual install (build frameworks or embed Xcode Project)

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. See the [Get Started](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) section for more details.

#### Podfile

First, 
```ruby
pod 'BSZoomGridScrollView'
```
then in your root project,
```ruby
pod install
```

### Installation with Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11+)

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) (SwiftPM) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code as well as C-family dependency. From Xcode 11, SwiftPM got natively integrated with Xcode.

BSZoomGridScrollView support SwiftPM from version 5.1.0. To use SwiftPM, you should use Xcode 11 to open your project. Click `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency`, enter [BSZoomGridScrollView repo's URL](https://github.com/boraseoksoon/BSZoomGridScrollView). Or you can login Xcode with your GitHub account and just type `BSZoomGridScrollView` to search.

After select the package, you can choose the dependency type (tagged version, branch or commit). Then Xcode will setup all the stuff for you.

If you're a framework author and use BSZoomGridScrollView as a dependency, update your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/boraseoksoon/BSZoomGridScrollView", from: "0.1.1")
    ],
    // ...
)
```
